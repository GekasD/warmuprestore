# Warmup Restore

This is a very simple sourcemod plugin that restores the original CS:GO warmup style.

### Small note

Valve has set `mp_respawn_immunitytime` to `-1` which disables spawn protection for people when they respawn, if you want to restore spawn protection make sure to change the value in your match/server config, the value before the change was `4` but you can obviously set it to whatever you want.
